      <h3><em>Portal 2</em></h3>
  
        <p>The recording sessions for <em>Portal 2</em> were great fun.  1 bit of direction was to <q cite="http://www.thinkwithportals.com/">make it sound like you were the announcer for a ride at Disneyland!</q>  I really didn't know how the final voice would sound. The effect was quite surprising!  So are some of the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TE67EpU9u40">comments</a> on the blogsites.</p> 
        
        <p>Surprisingly, there were a few fans who compiled the <abbr title="voice-overs">V/Os</abbr> of Announcer for Portal 2 and posted them to YouTube. The following video is a compilation of my recorded parts that appeared in the game. &nbsp; <a class="smallcapsarecool" href="http://theportalwiki.com/wiki/Announcer" target="_parent">More Portal 2</a></p>
