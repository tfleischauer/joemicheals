                	<h3>Caller</h3>
                  
                      <p>I have called at numerous dances, parties, and classes throughout the Northwest, California, and Canada including:</p>
                      
                        <ul>
                            <li class="disc"><small>Host for Teen Dance 1968 Washington State Square Dance Festival in Spokane</small></li>
                            <li class="disc"><small>Caller at Folk Life Festival at Seattle Center</small></li>
                            <li class="disc"><small>Caller for the 2013 Yakima Folk Life Festival</small></li>
                        </ul>   
                        
                        <p>I particularly enjoy seeing people who have never participated before, dancing within a couple of minutes.
    Iâ€™m always happy to discuss the fellowship and community building aspects of traditional dance.</p>
    
    				 <h3>Musician</h3>
                
                	<p>I also enjoy playing music as well as calling it. My instruments are acoustic guitar and bass. I play with a few bands in the northwest area primarily Red Crow, Swinging on a Star, and  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheElectrodes" target="_parent">The Electrodes.</a></p>
